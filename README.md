# NormansWebShop
A webshop for rust.

This "plugin" allows you to host a php site that makes it avaible to purchase items through the site and then claim them ingame!

To add or remove items check jsontabs and jsonitems folders, it's very basic. 

Note that the mysql server settings are in (/settings.php).

If you need help please make a Issue report, and i haven't been active recently on the Rust Webshop. It's mostly done but i there is such things to add like Search bars. I been working on a simple Online Card Game on C++ with Direct2d and i got it working, but i have been focusing on adding settings and Etcetera.    

The config for the Game Server Plugin is like anyother plugin.
